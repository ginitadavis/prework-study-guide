# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project so I could have my main notes saved and easy accesible for future reference. Now I am able to review what I have learned and add more information as I go.
I have learned how to create a HTML webpage, how to add style to it using CSS, and how to interact with it using funcions, loops, and conditions through the Javascript language. Now this webpage is uploaded to the internet and could be accessed by other FullStack students.

## Usage

This webpage lists the four topics the FullStack prework contains; HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript. Some of my main notes are written under each topic. When we open the DevTools console in Chrome, we can see the output from the Javascript coding we built.
